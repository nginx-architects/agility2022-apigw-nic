# Module 2: 

## Layer 7 Request Routing and API Versioning

As API's mature and developers continue to add features and functionality, it is oftentimes necessary to create new versions of those API's.  Access to these new versions is normally implemented by modifying the path (i.e. URL) of the API.  So you would see a path like /myapi/v1/colors for the original API and /myapi/v2/colors for the new, v2 version of the API.  While the path changes for the two versions, the FQDN would normally remain the same. With the NIC you will need to use "path-based" routing.  This is core functionality for all Ingress Controllers but it is easy to implement with NGINX custom resources VirtualServer.   

In this module you will learn:
1. The the VirtualServerRoute (VSR) Custom Resource
2. How to modify the VSR to route to new API versions
3. Cross Namespace routing
